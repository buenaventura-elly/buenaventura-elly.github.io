## **Welcome to Elly's website!**

# This is all about my characters lore. Enjoy!

## Eli M. Santiago
Someone who works for the syndicates. She never really planned on working for a famous syndicate group, but her brother just had to go and sabotage her happy little life. Don't worry, she doesn't do anything that severely bad. She was just forced to work so that she can survive the waves of debt and loan sharks that come after her because of her brother. Despite that, she works hard. Maybe she could find a better job someday. She lives in an apartment in Neon District, dated in 2047.

## Mary H. Adelaide
An engineer specializing on aerospace. She's your stereotypical workaholic who's obsessed with coffee. She's quite talented at the field of engineering, that's why she is respectable in the sector at the place she works at. Despite her low income (Because in Neon District, the economy is crashing and the government is ruled by the rich who couldn't care less about the working class) she works hard for herself and for her friends. Despite being born without legs (she is currently wearing prosthetics right now) she never let it bother her. Also lives on Neon District.

## Hayden R. Herrera
Used to be a busy corporate worker, now defending a shop from hordes of zombies. She is quite good at defending the shop- despite being inexperienced. It's just that the shops food is delicious and the bullets there are somehow infinite. It is quite motivating. She doesn't live in the same timeline as Eli and Mary- instead, she resides in another timeline / universe. (Haven't named it yet.)

That is all for lore, thank you!
